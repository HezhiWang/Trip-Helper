In 1697, a little over 70 years after the Dutch settled New York as a trading post known as New Amsterdam, Trinity Church was granted a charter by King William III of England. Since then, Trinity has been an integral part of New York City. Today, Trinity Church and St. Paul‰Ûªs Chapel (just a few blocks north) are the cornerstones of Trinity Church Wall Street, a growing and vibrant Episcopal community.Worship services are offered in Trinity Church throughout the week, including morning and evening prayer and a noonday Eucharist every weekday. On Sunday, the Trinity community gathers for Holy Eucharist at 9am and 11:15am, which is webcast live. All are invited to attend. Music by Trinity‰Ûªs renowned choir is integrated into many of the services and free concerts are held throughout the fall and spring. Find a calendar of worship services, concerts, and other events here.The steeple‰Ûªs 12 change-ringing bells are the only set in the United States; they rotate a full 360 degrees, producing a shimmering, cascading sound in a complex combination of changing tonal patterns. They can be heard on Sundays and special occasions.The present building is the third on the site, consecrated in 1846 and designed by British-born architect Richard Upjohn in the 19th century Gothic Revival style. The first church was lost in New York‰Ûªs Great Fire of 1776 and the second was demolished in 1839, at Upjohn‰Ûªs suggestion, after heavy snowfall revealed structural problems. The current building is a registered National Historic Landmark.Visitors to the church can view the decorative bronze doors at the Broadway entrance; see some of the oldest stained glass in the United States; or stop for a moment to pray in the nave or All Saint‰Ûªs Chapel, located in the northwest corner of the church.

In 1796, a handful of Black men, free and enslaved-along with James L. Varick, walked out of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church to establish a separate Black church called ""Zion."" The growth and development of Zion church mirrors the growth and development of New York itself. Starting in what is now the City Hall area, from its humble beginnings in a stable on Cross Street, Mother Zion has played a critical role in every aspect of African-American life during early New York City history.Many social organizations were founded to assist and improve the condition of the Negro, and Mother Zion Church played a key role in the growth process. William Miller, one of the trustees of Mother Zion, was selected as the first President of the New York African Society for Mutual Relief chartered by New York State in 1810. In 1817, the New York African Bible Society was established from his home.As one of the earliest and most vocal opponents of slavery and a constant champion of abolition, Mother Zion was there. In fact, Mother Zion became an important stop of the ""Underground Railroad,"" hiding slaves behind the pulpit in a secret passageway. ""Freedom's Journal,"" the first Black newspaper published in the United States, operated from the basement of Mother Zion Church from May 4, 1827 to May 2, 1828 for almost a year! Mother Zion's legacy is difficult to surpass, as it has always been a promoter of education and racial self-help for African Americans in this great city. Although our gains as a people have been significant against tremendous odds, the challenges are ever present.The nurturing of great men and women is another of Zion's legacies: Sojourner Truth transferred her membership from the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church to Zion Church in 1827. It was at the altar of Mother Zion that she changed her name to Sojourner Truth and there she was also reunited with her sisters who had been separated during slavery. Sojourner Truth became one of the foremost voices for women's and equal rights and the abolition of slavery. Mother Zion is also known as the ""Freedom Church."" Throughout its long history, Mother Zion has had many illustrious members who were leaders in our historic fight for freedom. They include Harriett Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Paul Robeson, Madame C.J. Walker and many others who fought so valiantly to free African Americans, socially, politically and spiritually. Today, it is the Mother Church of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church denomination located on five continents with a membership of over 1.5 Million. Mother Zion remains actively involved in all aspects of community involvement, and committed to the civil rights struggle, political empowerment and spiritual enhancement.
